The dream as a five-year old was to be an architect, but it took me 17 years to realize what that meant. As a kid, I always felt most comfortable using my mom’s iPod and playing certain video games. Now, I’m learning to understand why they were so easy to use in the first place. At my core, I enjoy building design-centric experiences that empower people to do more.

Currently, I'm learning the tricks of the trade by redesigning some of my favorite apps (with Figma), building a personal website from scratch (with HTML/CSS/Javascript), 
and playing with Kaggle datasets (Python/SQL). 

Outside the computer, you can catch me on a basketball court, hiking a local trail, listening to classic tunes, or keeping my fantasy squad ready. Feel free to reach out for a chat!
